## AsyncIterableBuilder class

A class that helps with building an  from a non-structured source.

In order to create the iteration, you must call the ,  and  methods with appropriate arguments.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export default class AsyncIterableBuilder<T> implements AsyncIterable<T> 
```
<b>Implements:</b> AsyncIterable

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `AsyncIterableBuilder` class.

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [\[Symbol.asyncIterator\]()](./polyethylene.asynciterablebuilder._symbol.asynciterator_.md) |  | Allows this class to work as a regular <code>AsyncIterable&lt;T&gt;</code> |
|  [done()](./polyethylene.asynciterablebuilder.done.md) |  | Makes the underlying iterable finish the iteration. |
|  [error(error)](./polyethylene.asynciterablebuilder.error.md) |  | Makes the underlying iterable throw the given <code>error</code> object. |
|  [toPolyAsyncIterable()](./polyethylene.asynciterablebuilder.topolyasynciterable.md) |  | Get a [PolyAsyncIterable](./polyethylene.polyasynciterable.md) that iterates the elements as determined by calls to <code>this</code> object's ,  and  methods. |
|  [value(obj)](./polyethylene.asynciterablebuilder.value.md) |  | Gives the underlying iterable a new value to be yielded. |
