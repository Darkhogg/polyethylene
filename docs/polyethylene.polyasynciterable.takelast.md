## PolyAsyncIterable.takeLast() method

Return a new iteration that iterates only over the last `num` elements. If there were less than than `num` elements in the iteration, all elements are yielded with no additions.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
takeLast(num: number): PolyAsyncIterable<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  num | number | The number of elements to yield |

<b>Returns:</b>

PolyAsyncIterable&lt;T&gt;

a new [PolyAsyncIterable](./polyethylene.polyasynciterable.md) that yields the last `num` elements elements of `this`

## Remarks

The returned iteration keeps a buffer of `num` elements internally in order to know which elements to keep. and so elements effectively get delayed until the iteration ends.
