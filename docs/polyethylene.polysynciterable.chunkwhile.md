## PolySyncIterable.chunkWhile() method

Return an iteration of arrays with elements of this separated based on the result of calling `func(elements)`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
chunkWhile(func: ChunkingPredicate<T>): PolySyncIterable<Array<T>>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  func | [ChunkingPredicate](./polyethylene.chunkingpredicate.md)<!-- -->&lt;T&gt; | A function that decides if an element is part of the current chunk or initiates a new one |

<b>Returns:</b>

PolySyncIterable&lt;Array&lt;T&gt;&gt;

A new [PolySyncIterable](./polyethylene.polysynciterable.md) that yields arrays with the elements of `this` as separated by `func`

## Remarks

The chunking process works by keeping an open \_current chunk\_ and calling `func` to decide whether the next element of the iteration will be part of the \_current chunk\_ or if it will be part of a new chunk.

To do this, `func` will be called for every element of the iteration except the first, which will automatically become part of the first chunk. If `func` returns `true`<!-- -->, the element will be part of the current chunk, and if it returns `false`<!-- -->, the \_current chunk\_ is closed and the element becomes the first element if the new \_current chunk\_. The arguments passed to `func` will be, in order: - `elem` - The element being currently processed - `lastElem` - The last element that was added to the current chunk - `firstElem` - The first element of the current chunk (might be the same as `lastElem`<!-- -->)

All elements will be part of a chunk, and no chunk will ever be empty.
