**Signature:**

```typescript
reduce<const U>(reducer: IndexedReducer<T, U>, init: U): U;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  reducer | [IndexedReducer](./polyethylene.indexedreducer.md)<!-- -->&lt;T, U&gt; | A function to call for all elements with the result of a previous call |
|  init | U | First element to be passed to the <code>reducer</code> function |

**Returns:**
