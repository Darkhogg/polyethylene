## PolySyncIterable.slice() method

Return a new iteration that starts from the `start`<!-- -->th element (included) and ends at the `end`<!-- -->th element (excluded) of `this`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
slice(start: number, end?: number): PolySyncIterable<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  start | number | The index of the first element returned |
|  end | number | _(Optional)_ The index of the first element \*not\* returned, inclusive |

**Returns:**

[PolySyncIterable](./polyethylene.polysynciterable.md)<!-- -->&lt;T&gt;

a new [PolySyncIterable](./polyethylene.polysynciterable.md) that yields the elements going that starts from the `start`<!-- -->th element (included) and ends at the `end`<!-- -->th element (excluded) of `this`

## Remarks

Both `start` and `end` allow for negative values, in which case they refer to the nth-to-last element, with n being the absolute value of the argument. `end` might also be `undefined`<!-- -->, in which case the iteration is not shortened on the end side, yielding up to the end, including the last element. This mimics the behaviour of [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)<!-- -->.

This function will likely need a buffer, effectively delaying the yielding of elements for a while.
